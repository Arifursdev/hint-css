# hint-css
hint.css by jQuery

[hint.css](https://github.com/chinchang/hint.css) is a CSS only tooltip library for your lovely websites.  

It is very easy to use where there are some problems when I use in [bootstrap-table](https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table).
For example: http://jsfiddle.net/wenyi/e3nk137y/6206/

I want to solve this problem but I don't have a good idea so I create this jQuery plugin.
